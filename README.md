# CPU-Renderer
A renderer which can load arbitary obj file and display it in a viewport with uv texture mapping,written completely from zero using only standard c++ library and CImg.
There are multiple projects in this solution from rendering dot in consol to rendering mesh in viewport which are my progress of testing and creating this renderer.
This project is unfinished and unpolished and is just my testing of rendering theory,but you can just play with it for some inspiration.
